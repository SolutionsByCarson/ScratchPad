# ScratchPad

A new Godot 4 pixel art game project. Currently scaffolding only — no gameplay code yet.

This file is the project journal and architectural overview. Update it whenever:
- A meaningful change ships (commit reference + one-line entry under "Journal")
- A decision lands (update "Project decisions" in [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md))
- We push to origin (refresh the journal so the public state reflects what's deployed)

## Quick links

- **Playbook & bookmarks:** [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md) — Godot 4 pixel-art settings, tooling, gotchas, project decisions table
- **Repo:** https://github.com/SolutionsByCarson/ScratchPad
- **Engine:** Godot 4.x (see `project.godot` for exact version when loaded)

## Project state (2026-05-01)

- Genre: undecided
- Base resolution, palette, tile size, art tool: all undecided — see "Project decisions" table in [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md)
- Pixel-perfect Project Settings: **not yet applied** to `project.godot` — defaults are still in place. To do before any sprites land.

## Architecture overview

Nothing is built yet. Default conventions we'll follow once we start, captured here so they're not re-debated:

- **Pixel-perfect rendering** — Stretch Mode `viewport`, Nearest filter, snap transforms to pixel. Detailed settings in [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md).
- **Composition over inheritance** — features are child nodes (HealthComponent, HitboxComponent, etc.), not deep class hierarchies.
- **Signals up, calls down** — parents call children directly; cross-tree communication goes through an `Events` autoload (event bus pattern).
- **TileMapLayer, never TileMap** — TileMap is deprecated as of Godot 4.3.
- **Custom Resource subclasses for save data** — type-safe, native Godot types. ConfigFile only for user settings, JSON only for tool/web interop.
- **State machines:** node-per-state FSM until a character has 5+ states; AnimationTree state machine above that.

## Workflow rules

- **Every codebase change → its own commit.** Each commit is a clean rollback point.
- **`.claude/` and other Claude-tooling files are gitignored.** This file (`CLAUDE.md`) is committed and is part of the project documentation.
- **Refresh this journal on push to origin.** The remote should always reflect the current architectural and project state.
- **Don't re-implement upstream docs.** Bookmark canonical Godot/tooling docs in the playbook; record only project-specific decisions and gotchas.

## Journal

Newest first. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD <short SHA> — what changed`.

- 2026-05-01 — Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (this file) + `docs/playbook.md` (bookmarks + decisions table). Library scope set: links and decisions, no upstream-doc duplication.
- 2026-05-01 `755868b` — Expanded `.gitignore` to cover `.claude/`, common AI assistant configs, editor metadata, and Godot export artifacts.
- 2026-05-01 `4c6cc3e` — Initial commit. Scaffold-only Godot 4 project (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `icon.svg`, `icon.svg.import`, `project.godot`).

## Open questions for the next session

1. What genre / game pillars are we aiming at? (Drives resolution, tile size, palette.)
2. Aseprite or Pixelorama? (Drives whether we install the AsepriteWizard plugin.)
3. Are we targeting desktop-only initially, or mobile/web from day one? (Stretch settings differ.)

Once any of these are answered, update the decisions table in [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md) and add a journal entry here.
